# Memory Game

The Memory Game is a project created for Udacity's **Front End Nanodegree** program. Through video lessons, reading material, and *hands on* projects, I was able to build on prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using these technologies, I've built a few projects that I am very proud of. None of them top the list like the *Memory Game*. The rules are simple and fun.

## Rules

**Stars**
1 star: Hit a match on the first go
1 star: For every 3 good matches
1 star: Every 20 points
Lose a star for 3 bad matches in a row

**Points**
10 points for a **good match**
Lose 5 points for a **bad match**
For every **20 points**, win a star

## Development
A lot of the development in this project was built with JavaScript. I chose *vanilla* JavaScript because I've worked with jQuery and really wanted to use and understand its core syntax. I'm proud of the progress I've made and things have worked out well.

## Future of the project
I'd love to enhance the game a bit more and ad features as I learn new technologies. It would be cool to se my progress as I build out a great game from what I'm currently learning. This would only solidify where I stand as a web developer.
